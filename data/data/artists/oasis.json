  "description": "Oasis was formed in 1991 in Manchester, England. With hits like \"Wonderwall,\" \"Don't Look Back in Anger,\" and \"Live Forever,\" they became one of the defining Britpop bands of the 1990s. In 2009, the band disbanded due to conflicts between the Gallagher brothers, Noel and Liam. Since then, both have pursued solo careers, though fans have long hoped for a reunion. In August 2024, Oasis announced their reunion and a world tour, bringing joy to their fans around the globe.",
